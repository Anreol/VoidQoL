- Heal everyone within the Void Cell each round start.
- Option to revive every dead player on each round start.
- Option to revive every dead player after the arena has been beaten.
- Option to multiply the Void Cell's charging radius.

## Planned Features
- Add options for Survivors of the Void Void Camps, such as minimum stage for void camps to appear, count, and others.
