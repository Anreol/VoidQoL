# VoidQoL
### **Note:** Since R2API didn't get updated yet, DebugToolkit cannot be used, because of this, this mod hasn't been tested much.

Server side and Vanilla compatible.
For now the mod just replicates Rob's VoidFieldsQoL which has features like...

## Features
- Increase Void Cell charge with enemy kills.
- Heal everyone within the Void Cell each round start.
- Option to revive every dead player on each round start.
- Option to revive every dead player after the arena has been beaten.
- Option to multiply the Void Cell's charging radius.

## Planned Features
- Add options for Survivors of the Void Void Camps, such as minimum stage for void camps to appear, count, and others.
